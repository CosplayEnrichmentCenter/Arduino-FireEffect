# Fire Effect

This project is a simple code base to create a fire/lava effect with an Arduino board and a WS2812B compatible LED-strip, for example a [NeoPixel](https://www.adafruit.com/category/168)

## Examples
* [Diablo 3 Marauder Shoulders](https://www.facebook.com/soocosplay/videos/1954157731462912/)

## Getting Started

To use this code, just clone the project on your computer. It can be directly uploaded to your arduino.
But first refer to the next parts.

### Dependencies
You will need to download [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) to use this code.
Use [this guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) if you don't know how to install it.

### Prerequisites

* You will need an arduino board. Visit the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/) for more information.
* Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to your computer
* Be sure [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) is added to your Arduino IDE librairies

## Deployment

After downloading the code, connect your Arduino board to your computer.
Then use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) to upload your code to your board.
